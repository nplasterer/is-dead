# Last Will and Testament
## Michael Skalnik

I, Michael Skalnik, of San Francisco, California, remove my former Wills and Codicils and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament.

### Payment of Debts and Expenses

Default on any debt that is possible.

### Everything else

* All my bicycles go to Jenn Chan, since she can ride them.
* My pet cat, Giro (Giraud), goes to Jenn Chan. If Jenn is unable or unwilling to take care of said kitty cat, Lydia Katsamberis is willed the cat.
* All Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and any other cryptocurrencies will be transfered to addresses provided by Yaroslav Shirokov (@sshirokov) unless he is to blame for my death. Then they will be directly transfered to the current mayor of San Francisco, of course if the candidate is not the deceased. http://skalnikformayor.com/
* I will all of my Github stock options to Naomi Plasterer.
